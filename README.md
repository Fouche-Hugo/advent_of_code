# Advent of Code 2023

My personal solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenge.

## How to Use
- each day is a separate folder with python files for each part of the challenge (`solve.py` for part 1 and `solve2.py` for part 2)
- each python file is executable and will print the solution to the console
- each day has a `input.txt` file with the input data for that day

## How to Run
- clone the repo
- `cd` into the directory `cd advent-of-code-2023`
- run the python file for the day/part you want to see the solution for
    - example: `day1/solve.py`
- the solution will be printed to the console
